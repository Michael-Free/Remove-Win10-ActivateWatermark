# Remove the Windows 10 Activation Watermark

You should always be using Genuine Windows 10 licenses. This registry modification is not for use to on pirated versions of Windows 10.  

However, there are times when Windows Activation is broken/corrupted or the PC air-gapped/unavailable on a network.  Windows 10 seems to mess around with you at times and assumes since there is no internet connection, it's going to re-apply that stupid "Activate Windows" watermark.  Sure, you could go through Microsoft's manual phone activation settings and be on your way... But the reality is that I shouldn't HAVE TO if this is already a legit license.

You can run this as a Powershell script, or you can run the single command in the .ps1 file in an Admin powershell console.
